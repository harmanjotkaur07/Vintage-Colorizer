# Vintage-Colorizer
Tags: numpy,OpenCV,tkinter,colorizer,PIL,os
I created this Deep Learning Project that aims to provide colorizing black & white images with Python.
In vintage colorizer, a black and white image is taken as input and a colored image
is produced. This projects solved with OpenCV deep neural network.A colorizer model is built
with the help of numpy and OpenCV using prototext,Caffemodel an NPY files and then  a G.U.I is created using tKinter,
colorizer and OpenCV where we can upload black and white pictures and convert them into colored pictures.
